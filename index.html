                        <p>Warren Edward Buffett (born August 30, 1930) is an American business magnate, investor, and
                            philanthropist. He is currently the chairman and CEO of Berkshire Hathaway. He is considered
                            one
                            of the most successful investors in the world and has a net worth of over $117 billion as of
                            March 2022,making him the world's sixth-wealthiest person.

                        <p>
                            Buffett was born in 1930 in Omaha, Nebraska, the second of three children and the only son
                            of Leila (née Stahl) and Congressman Howard Buffett.He began his education at Rose Hill
                            Elementary School. In 1942, his father was elected to the first of four terms in the United
                            States Congress, and after moving with his family to Washington, D.C., Warren finished
                            elementary school, attended Alice Deal Junior High School and graduated from Woodrow Wilson
                            High School in 1947, where his senior yearbook picture reads: "likes math; a future
                            stockbroker." After finishing high school and finding success with his side
                            entrepreneurial and investment ventures, Buffett wanted to skip college to go directly into
                            business but was overruled by his father.

                <div class="accordion-panel">
                    <p> Buffett was born in Omaha, Nebraska. He developed an interest in business and investing in his
                        youth, eventually entering the Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania in 1947 before
                        transferring to and graduating from the University of Nebraska at 19. He went on to graduate
                        from
                        Columbia Business School, where he molded his investment philosophy around the concept of value
                        investing pioneered by Benjamin Graham. He attended New York Institute of Finance to focus his
                        economics background and soon after began various business partnerships, including one with
                        Graham.
                        He created Buffett Partnership, Ltd in 1956 and his firm eventually acquired a textile
                        manufacturing
                        firm called Berkshire Hathaway, assuming its name to create a diversified holding company. In
                        1978,
                        Charlie Munger joined Buffett as vice-chairman
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Buffett displayed an interest in business and investing at a young age. He was inspired by a
                        book he borrowed from the Omaha public library at age seven, One Thousand Ways to Make
                        $1000. Much of Buffett's early childhood years were enlivened with entrepreneurial ventures.
                        In one of his first business ventures, Buffett sold chewing gum, Coca-Cola bottles, and weekly
                        magazines door to door. He worked in his grandfather's grocery store. While still in high
                        school, he made money delivering newspapers, selling golf balls and stamps, and detailing cars,
                        among other means. On his first income tax return in 1944, Buffett took a $35 deduction for the
                        use of his bicycle and watch on his paper route.In 1945, as a high school sophomore,
                        Buffett and a friend spent $25 to purchase a used pinball machine, which they placed in the
                        local barber shop. Within months, they owned several machines in three different barber shops
                        across Omaha. They sold the business later in the year for $1,200 to a war veteran.

                        In 1947, Buffett entered the Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania. He would have
                        preferred to focus on his business ventures, but his father pressured him to enroll.Warren
                        studied there for two years and joined the Alpha Sigma Phi fraternity.He then transferred
                        to the University of Nebraska where at 19, he graduated with a Bachelor of Science in Business
                        Administration. After being rejected by Harvard Business School, Buffett enrolled at Columbia
                        Business School of Columbia University upon learning that Benjamin Graham taught there. He
                        earned a Master of Science in Economics from Columbia in 1951. After graduating, Buffett
                        attended the New York Institute of Finance.

                        Buffett worked from 1951 to 1954 at Buffett-Falk & Co. as an investment salesman; from 1954 to
                        1956 at Graham-Newman Corp. as a securities analyst; from 1956 to 1969 at Buffett Partnership,
                        Ltd. as a general partner; and from 1970 as Chairman and CEO of Berkshire Hathaway Inc.

                        In 1951,Buffett discovered that Graham was on the board of GEICO insurance. Taking a train
                        to Washington, D.C. on a Saturday, he knocked on the door of GEICO's headquarters until a
                        janitor admitted him. There he met Lorimer Davidson, GEICO's vice president, and the two
                        discussed the insurance business for hours. Davidson would eventually become Buffett's lifelong
                        friend and a lasting influence,and would later recall that he found Buffett to be an
                        "extraordinary man" after only fifteen minutes. Buffett wanted to work on Wall Street but both
                        his father and Ben Graham urged him not to. He offered to work for Graham for free, but Graham
                        refused.

                        In 1962, Buffett became a millionaire because of his partnerships, which in January 1962 had an
                        excess of $7,178,500, of which over $1,025,000 belonged to Buffett. He merged these partnerships
                        into one. Buffett invested in and eventually took control of a textile manufacturing firm,
                        Berkshire Hathaway. He began buying shares in Berkshire from Seabury Stanton, the owner, whom he
                        later fired. Buffett's partnerships began purchasing shares at $7.60 per share. In 1965, when
                        Buffett's partnerships began purchasing Berkshire aggressively, they paid $14.86 per share while
                        the company had working capital of $19 per share. This did not include the value of fixed assets
                        (factory and equipment). Buffett took control of Berkshire Hathaway at a board meeting and named
                        a new president, Ken Chace, to run the company. In 1966, Buffett closed the partnership to new
                        money. He later claimed that the textile business had been his worst trade.He then moved
                        the business into the insurance sector, and, in 1985, the last of the mills that had been the
                        core business of Berkshire Hathaway was sold.

                        Buffett became a billionaire when Berkshire Hathaway began selling class A shares on May 29,
                        1990, with the market closing at $7,175 a share.In 1998 he acquired General Re (Gen Re) as
                        a subsidiary in a deal that presented difficulties—according to the Rational Walk investment
                        website, "underwriting standards proved to be inadequate," while a "problematic derivatives
                        book" was resolved after numerous years and a significant loss. Gen Re later provided
                        reinsurance after Buffett became involved with Maurice R. Greenberg at AIG in 2002.

            <p> The biggest advantage of growth investment strategies is that they give you exposure to the fastest
                growing
                sectors and industries. This means you are allocating capital to companies with the best chance of
                generating high annual returns. Investing in growth stocks is also exciting, and you get to learn about
                the
                companies that are innovating and creating the future. However, growth investing should be approached
                with
                caution.
                ,</p>
            <p>
                Growth stocks typically have the highest valuations in the market. They need to live up to the market’s
                expectations to justify their valuations, or the stock price will correct – often very dramatically. If
                you
                are investing in growth stocks you need to do your homework and avoid chasing companies that are based
                on
                sentiment alone.
            </p>
        </div>
        <div class="tab-panel" id="two">
            <p>The simplest long-term investment strategy is buy and hold investing. Individual stocks are simply bought
                and held indefinitely. How well a buy and hold portfolio performs will obviously depend on the companies
                that are held. Although buy and holding is the simplest of investment strategies, it can be more
                effective
                than one might assume. Investors are often their own worst enemies and frequently sell their investments
                at
                the wrong time. This approach removes that problem for the equation.
            </p>
            <p>
                There are two ways you can vastly improve the probability of success for a buy and hold portfolio.
                Firstly,
                look for stocks that are likely to be around for a long time. Stocks with a strong brand that are not
                likely
                to be disrupted are a good option. Secondly, keep your positions small. That way the picks you get wrong
                won’t do too much damage to your portfolio. And, the stocks that do very well will grow into substantial
                positions in your portfolio.
            </p>
        </div>
        <div class="tab-panel" id="three">
            <p> Value investing has produced the most consistent long-term returns over the last 100 years. Warren
                Buffett
                made his fortune investing in companies with reliable earnings at attractive prices. Value investors buy
                stocks trading at or below their intrinsic or fair value. This provides a margin of safety when the
                unexpected happens. The lower the valuation is when a stock is purchased, the less the company has to
                earn
                to generate a decent return in the future.
            </p>
            <p>
                Value investors must understand financial statements to determine the true value of a company. Most
                cheap
                stocks are cheap for a reason. A value investor’s job is to identify the high quality, cheap stocks.
            </p>
        </div>
        <div class="tab-panel" id="four">
            <p> Momentum investing is similar to growth investing but considers the stock’s price momentum rather than
                earnings or revenue growth. Evidence suggests that the top performing stocks during a given period have
                a
                high probability of outperforming during subsequent periods.
            </p>
            <p>
                Buying and selling decisions are therefore made using price action alone, though it helps to avoid small
                and
                illiquid companies. A very simple momentum strategy would invest in 10 to 20 top performing stocks and
                hold
                them for 12 months. At this point all stocks are sold and the process is repeated. More complex
                variations
                of the strategy will continuously rotate capital into stock with the highest momentum on a monthly or
                quarterly basis.
            </p>
        </div>
        <div class="tab-panel" id="five">
            <p>
                The objective of dividend investing, also known as income investing or yield investing, is to generate
                an income stream. Stocks with high dividend yields are usually very profitable but have relatively low
                growth rates. As a dividend investor, your job is to find companies with good yield that will be able to
                continue paying dividends. If the company is able to increase its dividend yield, that’s even better.
              </p>
              <p>
                Dividend investment strategies are not just about generating income. If dividends are reinvested, a
                yield portfolio can experience substantial capital growth too. Companies that pay dividends are
                typically quite profitable and therefore also defensive during recessions
